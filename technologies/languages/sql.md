What are the general SQL expectations at FAANG? How does one define advanced SQL skills?

I would say I have advance SQL. I can comfortably do the following.

- recursive joins
- subqueries
- regex
- window function
- json extraction
- self joins
- user defined function
- loops
- arrays

Is there anything I’m missing/lacking?

That’s way more than needed (for interviews).

- correlated and uncorrelated subqueries
- Common table expressions
- All kinds of joins
- Window Functions
- Case statements


The thing that stumps most candidates in SQL interviews is not having familiarity with the data/schema. So being able to read the schema and come up with the best approach to tackle the question within a short timeframe is the key. Some companies have rapidfire questions e.g 4-5 mediums in 30 mins. If you spend time thinking too much you’re toast even if you have world class sql skills.
