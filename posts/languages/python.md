# Python

## Comments
``` py
# Python comments.

"""
Multi-line comment.
Uses 3 double quotes (") or single quotes (').

These are supposed to be string literals, but Python ignores them if they're
not assigned to any variable, so it can function as a comment.
"""

'''
This also works fine.
This style of multi-line comments apparently isn't favored.
'''

# Multi-line comments are apparently preferably
# done using multiple single-line comments.
