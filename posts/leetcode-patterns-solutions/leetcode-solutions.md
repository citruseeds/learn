## Notes
## Solution Code
``` py
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Base case: tiles on the topmost/leftmost only have 1 path to reach, since can only move right/down
        # (out of bounds considered as 0)
        dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        # Ignore the first row/col since it's already known to be 1
        for col in range(1, m):
            for row in range(1, n):
                # The number of paths to a given tile is equal to the number of paths of the tile above/left of it
                dp[col][row] = dp[col - 1][row] + dp[col][row - 1]
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
